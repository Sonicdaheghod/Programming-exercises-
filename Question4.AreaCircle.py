#4- Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user.
# The purpose of this activity is to practice on implementing math functions to have a desired output for real life applications.


#givens: r = 1.1
#formula = pi(r^2)

#1-parameters
radius = 1.1

Area = int(3.14*radius)
#2- output area
print("The area of a bubble with a radius of 1.1 meters is", Area , "meters")
